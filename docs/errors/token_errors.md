# Errors

Once you've added your Personal Access Token to the CSV Importer, you can run into several errors that maybe difficult to diagnose. Here are some common ones:

## 401 Unauthorized

The token you've configured doesn't give access to this instance of Firefly III

## Could not resolve host

The CSV importer can't find the host where your Firefly III instance is running.

## Your Firefly III version X is below the minimum required version Y

The error says it all, really.

## Other errors?
