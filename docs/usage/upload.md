# Uploading files

On this page you'll find instructions on how to upload files into the CSV importer.

## About the CSV file

Always upload the CSV file from your bank. If the file contains any lines before the data starts, you must remove them manually. Make sure the file is encoded in UTF-8. Use a tool like Sublime Text or Notepad++ to convert the file if necessary.

## Common problems and errors

- The file must be UTF8 encoded.
- No extra text may be present before or after the data.
