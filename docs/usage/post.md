## Importing multiple files

You can submit a POST request to the following URL to make the CSV importer import stuff:

`POST http://your-csv-importer/autoimport`

Optionally, provide the `directory` argument to tell the CSV importer from which directory to import from.

The result will be that the CSV importer imports whatever is in that directory.
