# Firefly III CSV importer documentation

This is the [Firefly III CSV importer](https://github.com/firefly-iii/csv-importer) documentation. Welcome!

## What is the CSV Importer?

The Firefly III CSV Importer is a tool that you can use you import data from CSV files into Firefly III. It has several interesting features, and it can be used to import data manually, semi-automated or entirely automated.

## What can it do for me?

The CSV importer can be used to import CSV files into Firefly III. You can use [premade configuration files](https://github.com/firefly-iii/import-configurations/) or set up your own import routine. With a little tinkering, you can do this fully automatically.

## What can't it do for me?

The CSV importer can't connect to your bank or download files for you. You have to supply the files yourself.

## How can I use it?

You can install the CSV importer either self hosted, through Docker, or you can use the online variant. Keep in mind that the online variant is hosted by me and doesn't guarantee the privacy or safety of the documents you upload.

## Can I see the code?

You can find the source of [Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii) and the [Firefly III CSV importer](https://github.com/firefly-iii/csv-importer) on GitHub.
